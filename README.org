#+TITLE: README

This my [[https://github.com/djpohly/dwl/][dwl]] configuration ([[https://dwm.suckless.org/][dwm]] for [[https://wayland.freedesktop.org/][wayland]]).

/Disclaimer/: I do not know/use =C= and I barely know what I'm doing!

* Overview

Every couple of years, I check if "wayland is ready" or more likely whether I'm ready for wayland.

The configuration is usable with a "modest" attempt to implement a [[https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/][ratpoison-like]] keybindings (=Control+t= prefix).

* Patches

For the =autostart= patch, I apply changes from [[https://github.com/sevz17/dwl][sevz17/dwl]].

|-----------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Patch     | Purpose                                         |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------+
| [[https://github.com/djpohly/dwl/wiki/autostart][autostart]] | Run programs on startup                         |
| [[https://github.com/djpohly/dwl/wiki/keychord][keychord]]  | Implement =ratpoison= like keybindings =custom= |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------+

* Keybindings

Key bindings are defined in =config.def.h=.

My initial idea was to leverage [[https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd][swhkd]]:
- That would require writing a reasonably complete IPC implementation for interacting with =dwl= externally.
- I don't really like the fact that parts of =swhkd= need to run as root via =pkexec=, in comparison to [[https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd][sxhkd]]

* How to run it

I'm currently using [[https://git.sr.ht/~raphi/somebar][somebar]] as status bar.

#+begin_src sh
  dbus-run-session dwl -s somebar
#+end_src

A new [[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]] VM running Void Linux =x86_64-musl= ([[https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/guides/fde.html][UEFI with full disk encryption]]).
